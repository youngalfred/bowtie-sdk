            Credible Insurance requires a few details before you can submit
            a partial application on behalf of a customer. After you've
            completed the following four fields, you can submit your customer's
            info and expect him/her to receive a personalized email from Credible Insurance
            inviting him/her to resume the insurance application you started.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should NOT submit actual customer data while using this Bowtie demo. You can, however,
            update the email with your own to test the true customer experience.
            Keep in mind that when resuming the applciation on Credible, you (or the customer) will be
            required to verify the email and birth date values entered here before the insurance application
            can be accessed and resumed.
        </p>

            As you seek to prefill other bowtie-sdk fields for your customers, you can reference the
            sampleApp.json file in this demo.
